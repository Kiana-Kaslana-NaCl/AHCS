# AHCS

AHCS_updatekiller adopts a relatively elegant method to stop the Windows Update for 1000 years. Moreover, you can recovery it anytime when you want to update Windows.

If you want to continue the update after delaying Windows Update, please click the "Continue Update" button within the system settings.

AHCS_updatekiller will create the C:\kiana directory to store the necessary files for operation. If you accidentally delete it, please do not worry, it will be automatically created the next time it runs.
