AHCS_updatekiller:

AHCS_updatekiller adopts a relatively elegant method to stop the Windows Update for 1000 years. Moreover, you can recovery it anytime when you want to update Windows. It achieves a longer pause duration by overwriting the string of the pause update duration in the Windows registry. As of now (2025.03), the longest time we can write is 975 years (up to 3000.08.24).
